# latitudinal-weather

First part of this project is an exercise in making API calls in Python, in this case to Open Weather Map, and cross-referencing the results with datafrom CitiPy.  The data was then converted to a Pandas dataframe and visulaized using Matplotlib.  The second part is a website I put together using Bootstrap to present the data, which is live [here.] (hayden4davey.github.io/lat)
