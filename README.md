# latitudinal-weather

This is a two part project I worked on at school last fall.  First part is an exercise in making API calls in Python, in this case to Open Weather Map.  The data was then converted to a Pandas dataframe and visulaized using Matplotlib.  The second part is a website I put together to present the data.
